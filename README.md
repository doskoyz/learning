# learning as a software engineer for 10 years
Hello, my name is Dios. I've been working as a software engineer for 10 years. Here is a summary of my experiences and challenges: 
  * Binus University (Education, Platform) (3 years)
    * Research Team
      Challenges: How do we face the new technology and think about how it can help us?
    * Binusmaya Team:
      Challenges: How to match the lecturer's schedule with the students' and manage class absences until the lecturer receives an honorarium.
  * Traveloka (Travel Platform) (2.5 years)
    * Bus and Train Team:
      Challenges: How to maintain the stability of the system, even though the provider is not stable?
  * Gudangada (Commerce Platform) (2.5 years)
    * Payment & Finance Team: How to manage the payment in/out with precision and create the journal for each detailed transaction?
  * Blibli (Commerce Platform) (2+ years)
    * Return Team: How to manage the flow that has so many dependencies (order, finance, logistics, insurance, etc)?

There are so many challenges that I have faced in 10 years, and I want to share my experience so that you can learn.
## Programming language
* I code with different programming languages at each company, focusing on the principles of programming languages, not the language itself (When I used Java 21, it was so different with the java7), so there is no point in thinking about the syntax and framework. Better try to think about how this language works, like the memory management (garbage collector), thread management, observability, etc.
